# Retinal-Vessels-Segmentation
Matlab implementation of a retinal vessels segmentation alogorithm using the Chan-Vese segmentation method from a Matched Filter response.

## Database 
The proposed method has been developed using the available STARE images (https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/probing/index.html)
On the basis of visual inspection a further classification of the 20 retinal fundus slides has been performed considering intensity based features such as contrast, non uniform illumination effects and presence of artifacts due to the non-idealities in the  acquisition process.
